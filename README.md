# LearningSpark

Update: I have stopped this learning to spend more time on learning more full stack languages

This reposiotry will hold my PySpark apps as I learn utilizing "Learning Spark"(1) as well as various tutorials found online. I will be running these apps on the free HortonWorks 2.5 VM (2).
